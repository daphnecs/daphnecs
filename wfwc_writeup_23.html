<p>Where do I even begin? This ride broke me down and built me back up, over and over again. I reached my limit every day, and then I kept going. </p>

<p>I woke up to rain tapping on the outside of my tent. Shit. I really didn’t want to start in the rain, but I guess I would be. It’s 5:30 in the morning - too early in my opinion. I got dressed. At least the rain pants I bought in a panic a few days before would get their use. I packed up my damp tent, trying to keep the wet shell separated from the rest of my stuff so that I wouldn’t have to deal with an entirely soaked camping setup that night. Oh well, not much to do about that. I ate some toast, and didn’t get as much coffee as I would’ve liked. I dropped my transfer bags in the van and sped over to the start. I’m sure Tyler said a few words, but I couldn’t tell you now. All I could think about was the ride ahead, and then we were moving. The rain was cold. The wind stung my skin. Almost immediately the groups began to split. I tried to stay with the front group but felt myself falling back. Fuck it. I’m not having fun, I can’t be bothered to stick with the peloton. I dropped off and began to ride on my own. This is miserable. I rode by myself for an hour or so. All I could think was how was I going to make it 4 more days? </p>

<p>At some point a group appeared behind me and began to overtake me. “Hæhæ! Would you like to join our group?” Suddenly there were 7 women furiously pedaling around me. They had a rotating peloton going. The left moves forward while the right moves back. Despite the horrible weather they were smiling and laughing as they battled the fierce wind and rain. Once I fell into their groove, time sped up. We picked up another woman, Isabel. She happened to be a 24 year old from England, and a master’s student in Ísafjörður. Finally things were looking up. I had allies against the elements, and we were almost to the first cultural connection - a waffle hut in Litlibær. It was a relief to go inside. We still had another 200k or so, but the break was much needed. Despite the warm waffles and hot coffee I was still freezing. My top layers were all soaked through. I guess I should’ve bought the expensive gore-tex jacket from the store, but this trip was expensive enough. Izzy offered me a wool top. “Are you sure?” I questioned. She said she was and I put it on. The dry layer saved me. We went back outside to push on. The weather eventually cleared. The wind may have still been brutal, but things were looking up. I started talking to more of the women I was riding with. They were all from Reykjavík, and most of them were on a team together. Multiple of them had daughters my age. They started joking they’d adopted Izzy and me. The conditions were awful, but these women were making the most of it. They’d sing as they rode, make jokes, and dance when they were stopped. Eventually we got to our lunch stop for the day, at the hotel in Heydalur. I gulped down my warm soup and started feeling much better. Some of the women’s husbands appeared to be driving the route, and gave the women a blow up monkey they named Bobo to bring along for the ride. </p>

<p>The women had a plan. We’d stop every 1.5 hours or so for a 2 minute food and bathroom break. I learned you really can fill up your bottles anywhere here, as long as the water is somewhat fast moving. The day passed faster and faster. Sometimes the husbands would drive by blasting music for us to sing along to. We made it to a mountain climb. It was long. 20km or so up. I was warned it’d be cold at the top, which we couldn’t see as it was shrouded in clouds. Up we went. It wasn’t as bad as I thought, but it was challenging. Up and up, the clouds were so thick, I continually thought we were at the top, but it would turn out to be another false flat. Finally we reached a point where we started going down. This was it, the big descent. It felt amazing to descend in a peloton of women. As the road steepened and my speed crept up, the clouds parted to reveal a sunlit valley. The first bit of sun we’d seen all day! It was magical. We flew down the hill into the valley and took a quick snack stop. We’d finished the big climb and were close to the end. I was ready to get this day over with. It finally felt nice out, and the riding felt easier. Until we encountered another hill less than 10km from the finish. It kept going up, and it was steep. I felt myself beginning to bonk. I let the group go ahead and laid down on the road. This already felt like the hardest day of my life. I didn’t want to go up the damn hill, but I was so close to the end. I slammed 2 gels and got back on my bike. I was slow, snaking my way up the steep grade. Finally I made it. I could almost see where we were headed for the night. I rolled into the Hotel Laugarhóll relieved and exhausted. At least there’s a hot pot to swim in! After dinner and a swim I felt somewhat revived. The wifi was terrible but I attempted to call James. The day had been draining and I needed the emotional boost. I probably should’ve gone right to bed, but it was worth it to hear his voice. I went to bed knowing it’d be another night of not enough sleep, but at least that I was prepared for. </p>

<h1 id="day-2-">Day 2:</h1>
<p>Woke up again to rain. It was hard to get out of bed. Staying in my warm sleeping bag was a strong temptation, but there was a strict start time or risk disqualification. At least this time the rain was light and cleared up before we rolled out. I packed more layers today after my experience the day before. I didn’t want to get cold again. I was running late. I missed the group rollout. I was panicked but realized there were plenty of others counting on the 30 minute grace period to get moving. I felt good rolling out. The coffee was kicking in. I found my girls to ride with. The wind was still strong, but I was just so happy to not be riding in the rain of the day before. </p>

<p>Today there was a lot more climbing. Lots of ups and downs. My stomach was bothering me a little bit, but nothing bad. We had a delicious sweet potato soup for lunch with salty bread rolls at the Sheep Farming Museum. While I was enjoying the company of the group, I decided to go off on my own so I could stop less frequently. I met up with Peter, and found it fun to ride with just one other person for a while. We decided to go out of our way for a waffle stop in Borðeyri. At this point my stomach was really bothering me and I desperately needed a bathroom. We ate waffles, I used the bathroom (twice), and our mood was high. We weren’t going fast, but I’d been feeling decently good that day. Eventually we set off to continue the ride. </p>

<p>We’d immediately be going up a mountain pass. It didn’t take long on the bike for me to realize my GI discomfort was still present. I tried to ignore it, but it wasn’t going away. As we continued to ascend into the clouds the light sprinkle turned into rain. It was getting colder and we were pushing into a strong headwind. When we finally reached the top it seemed like we’d be able to descend out of the bad weather. Instead, the headwind was so strong, and the gradient too mild. Although we were going down gradient, it didn’t feel like it. Not to mention it was still raining and my stomach was feeling worse and worse. Peter kept asking me if I was ok and warning me these were hypothermic conditions. I assured him I was ok, but I didn’t feel like it. We were still quite far from the next cultural connection and there was nowhere to take shelter. I was getting worse. The discomfort in my abdomen was so strong I couldn’t push my legs. My heart rate was dropping and the rain wasn’t letting up. We were in a remote area and cars weren’t passing by, nor were there many houses. The houses that were there mostly looked empty. Eventually I saw a large square shaped building. Perhaps some sort of business? There was a shipping container in front, and multiple vehicles parked there. It looked like my best bet for finding a human to help. I rolled up the driveway and saw what was clearly a front door. As I walked up the steps I looked in the large glass window to my right and saw a dining and living room with people sitting inside. An older Icelandic man opened the door. “Uh sorry to bother you, but could I please use your bathroom?” I asked while shivering. “Ah yes, downstairs,” he responded, looking confused as he directed me down a steep staircase away from the dining room where the other people were. It felt great to be inside, despite the weirdness of being in an unknown place. I stripped off my layers. I wasn’t wet, but I was really cold. After a few minutes I walked back up. There was no one in the entryway so I walked into the dining room, which extended into a large living room space. Multiple men sat there watching TV. “Could I actually stay and warm up for a little while?” I asked. A different man walked up to me. “Of course, are you doing the race?” Turns out he was best friends with another man racing who had only stopped by 2 hours earlier. There was a girl in the dining room setting the table who asked if I’d like a cup of tea. I felt bad for imposing but accepted. I went outside to ask Peter if he could come in and talk to me. He’d been diligently waiting outside, snacking under the cover of the porch. He told me I didn’t look ok. I felt awful, and knew there was no way I could leave the warmth of the house, much less continue as long as I would need to in order to reach the next spot. I called for a pickup, although I was pretty devastated to do so. Peter stayed until he knew someone would be coming for me and then left to finish. It was already past 10pm. He wouldn’t be finishing for a few more hours. I called James. At least this place had good wifi. The girl working as a server there, Andrea, made me get out of all my wet clothes and take a hot shower. When I came out she told me I couldn’t have a wet head and got me a blow dryer. She brought me wool blankets and food and gave me a stylish Harley Davidson jacket to wear. She had to serve dinner, but kept checking on me when she had a moment. James stayed on the phone with me throughout, listening to me babble and cry. I have a hard time accepting help and I don’t like anyone, much less strangers see me in such a bad state. It was humbling. Eventually I stopped shaking and started to warm up. Dóra arrived, and even had my duffle bag so I could get into my own warm clothes. I don’t remember her exact words, but as I left Andrea said so genuinely something along the lines of I should always remember to ask for help when I need it. Despite my own hang ups with asking for help, these strangers showed me unimaginable hospitality and taught me an important lesson at the same time. I’ll never forget the gift she gave me that day. As we were almost to our destination for the night, the Vogur Country Lodge, we encountered the group of Icelandic women I’d been riding with before. We rolled in the final kilometer behind them. They were in rough shape, but still determined. I got to eat dinner with them at 1am. They encouraged me to not give up and ride with them the next day. Their husbands assured me they’d be driving the course and would help me if needed. It was the boost I needed to keep going. I cried in my tent feeling absolutely broken by this race. I wasn’t sure how I would push on, but I wanted to try. At 3am I went to bed. </p>

<h1 id="day-3-">Day 3:</h1>
<p>I woke up in a daze. I felt so out of it, but I forced myself up and to breakfast for coffee and oatmeal. I got dressed. It finally felt warmer which was a relief, but some of my clothes were still damp from the night before. I packed all my layers. If I couldn’t make it today, I didn’t want the weather to be the reason. It was a good thing I was already disqualified because I was 6 minutes late from the cutoff time to leave. Oh well. I got in my aero bars, put on some music, and sped through the first gravel section to the morning checkpoint. I passed my female friends and some others, and then met up with them again at the Handverksfélagið restaurant. </p>

<p>My stomach felt a little better today, but all there was to eat was a creamy cauliflower soup. My esophagus felt like it was closed. I struggled to get it down. Cream has a lot of lactose and I’ve been vegan for years. I worried my body wouldn’t react well to this, but there wasn’t another option. I needed calories. It did feel like a bit of a relief that I was no longer officially part of the race. I didn’t worry about stopping when I needed to change a layer, eat a snack, or pee. I motored on, but my tummy aches and frequent bathroom breaks led to me getting caught by the women again. I decided to stick with them. It’d be a long gap before we got food again, and there were quite a few major climbs on the way.</p>

<p>At the bottom of one valley, multiple of the women’s families were congregated to say hi and cheer us on. It was sunny and we stopped for a few minutes. I had to pee, but we were on the side of a somewhat busy road and there were a lot of people around. There wasn’t really anywhere to go, so I walked away from the group behind some tall grasses and pulled down my pants. I’m already a bit pee shy when I know cars are going by, but I really had to go and felt better afterwards. As I was walking back to the group a man stopped his car in front of me and started yelling at me in Icelandic. I said “what?” very confused, and he furiously went off on me about how inappropriate it was to expose myself like this on the side of the road. One of the best parts of riding with these women was realizing I had the freedom to pee anywhere! We had been stopping on the side of the road anywhere and everywhere for group pee breaks. Cars would pass by and other women would give us the thumbs up. I thought the culture here was more relaxed but this man was clearly very upset. I tried to apologize and explain that after cycling 500 kilometers already, I really didn’t have the energy to go out of my way to find a real bathroom. Seriously, if he didn’t like seeing my ass, he shouldn’t look at it. As if I wasn’t already uncomfortable and tired enough from this experience. Luckily I walked back to my group of friends, and despite him leaving his car parked near our group lingering, I knew he couldn’t do anything. The women were shocked. “He really said that to you?” “The sheep pee everywhere!” “No Icelandic person should ever say that!” “How rude!” “Don’t listen to that asshole!” At least it felt good to have the camaraderie of this group of women.</p>

<p>On one of the next hills, the husbands set up a cafe pop-up (in their own words). They were serving the riders hot coffee with their jet boils, and homemade Happy Marriage cake, along with cokes and coffees. It was so lovely! Isabel had dropped out the day before, but she was there with them being a supportive friend. We descended and climbed again. And again. My stomach was still bothering me. As we were going up a big climb, it got really bad. I stopped on the side of the road, doubled over in pain. I texted James to let him know I wasn’t sure I could do it. I didn’t want to quit but I felt horrible. It clearly wasn’t getting better. I told James I’d text him when I was safe. I finally made it up the mountain and began descending. Down the road I saw one of the women waving her arms at me. As I got closer I saw all their bikes on the side of the road. They were sheltered behind a large boulder, out of the wind. Brynja was in the emergency bivy. I told them I wasn’t ok. They’d already called for a pickup. I got in the bivy with Brynja and was given an aluminum foil blanket to put on. I took off my outer layers and wrapped it around my core, and put my puffy on over. The other woman left once the men were on the way. We were both shivering and clutching each other to stay warm. She was having the same issues as I was. Because her stomach was bothering her and her throat felt closed, it was hard to get down calories. Resultantly, we couldn’t push our legs, our heart rates would drop, and we’d get really cold. To pass the time for our rescue, she told me the story of rescuing herself when she’d broken her knee ski touring the year before. She’d broken her knee in a remote area of the westfjords only accessible by boat and managed to make it out without requiring a helicopter, and then went home and to work before finally getting an x-ray and medical care days later. She was such a badass and even had a daughter my same age. We swapped more stories of times we’d needed rescue. I felt really connected over our shared penchant for dangerous activities. We questioned why we are both so drawn to activities that push the limits, and don’t always end well. Eventually her husband came, along with one of the others. She clutched my arm to get to the car, telling me her knee still gives her problems on rough terrain. Of course I was upset about not finishing, but I felt supported. I let James know what had happened and that I was ok. I knew he was worried. The other man turned around and held out Toblerone. We tried to refuse, and he said “you climbed a mountain, so you should have toblerone.” We accepted. It did taste good. They had coke for us as well. I usually don’t like coke, but at that moment it tasted good, and helped to settle my stomach a little. We drove to the next stop in Flókalundur. The pizza looked delicious, but our stomachs were in distress. We split a plate of fries and could barely finish, although we did manage to get some beer down to drown our sorrows. Defeated again. </p>

<p>After seeing our friends and cheering them on as they headed out for their final leg we went to the finish for that night at the Patreksfjörður community hall. It was probably midnight when we rolled in, but there were still many people out on the course. We were both camping, and immediately headed for the building to get a hot shower. No luck. This location had none. Dinner was self-serve backpacking meals, or over salted veggie soup. I forced some down, and gave myself a paper towel bath in the restroom, but it was disappointing to say the least. I talked to James on the phone from my tent before bed. It was the middle of the night but it cheered me up to hear his voice. I really wished he was there with me. Others had family members and significant others here to support them, and while I’d made friends it wasn’t the same. He could tell me it’s ok over the phone, but I really just wanted him there with me for a hug. Around 4am I finally passed out. </p>
        
<h1 id="rest-day">Rest Day</h1>
<p>I woke up at 12:30pm. The final race day would start at midnight, and we had the day off before to rest and recharge. I found vegan skyr and coffee in the community hall and made a pb&j. No more eating things that weren’t vegan, as it obviously wasn’t working for me. I wasn’t sure if I’d ride the next day. I walked to a convenience store with some of the women. They again encouraged me to at least start the day. It’d be harder to get a pickup because most of the husbands were riding, but there were also shortcuts that cut the course significantly and detoured around the most challenging sections. I did laundry and took a nap before thinking about it more. I spent more time talking to James. He said it was hard hearing me in such a bad place. The calls kept dropping and we’d call each other back. I came to the conclusion I would ride. He wanted me to talk through my plans for the next day to make sure I’d be safe. There’d be more food stops. The temperatures would be warmer, and there was no rain on the forecasts. I could take the tunnels if needed. There’d be more riders on the course for the final day, as it was also listed as a separate one day event. More people to help if needed. I had my Garmin inReach and my emergency bivy. I was nervous but determined to complete the damn thing. I ate some dinner (more soup) and went back to bed for another nap. I couldn’t fall asleep, but I at least rested my body and eyes. At 10:30pm I packed up my tent and got dressed for my final day of riding. </p>

<h1 id="day-4-">Day 4:</h1>
<p>We set out promptly at 12:00am under the midnight sun. It was magical. Immediately we went up a large mountain climb. I felt amazing. Down the mountain, up another. It was beautiful. I descended the road in the secret life of Walter Mitty that he does on a skateboard. It was just as good as it looked in the movie. It was the middle of the night, and as we rode into Bíldudalur, the town was alive. People were out and about. Drinking and socializing. Turns out it was the annual green bean festival. It felt a bit surreal. And of course, it’s still light and bright out regardless of the early hour. The waffle stop was at the quirky Icelandic sea monster museum. They were the best waffles of the trip. I had 3. I felt great, and was motivated by the beautiful scenery. </p>

<p>This time the pass would be long. I made it to the top and for the first time all week, had an amazing lookout without the cloud cover. The wind was strong and bitter cold, but the view was worth the effort. The pass was long. The headwind made for very slow going. At one point I climbed down into a creek bed to get a break from the wind and have a snack break. </p>

<p>Despite the weather I was having an incredible time. I felt as though I was riding on another planet. Eventually we descended to the Dynjandi waterfall, the tallest in the westfjords. It was incredibly cool to see the base of what I’d just ridden over on top. The waterfall continued to be in view as I biked around the next fjord. Incredibly powerful and giant. </p>

<p>Lunch was in a tiny grass covered roof cottage in the Hrafnseyri village. They didn’t have vegan soup. Oh well, I packed a lot of food for today. Others were taking a nap and didn’t seem to be in the best spirits. I had a pastry and went out alone to conquer the next section. By this point I had long past the first tunnel shortcut and was committed to completing the Svalvogar gravel road section around the fjord - supposedly the most challenging section of the whole 4 days, but also the most beautiful. The ride had been challenging, but incredibly gorgeous all day and I knew I’d be regretful if I skipped the best part of the route. </p>

<p>I was riding solo and stopped a lot to take photos. This ride was for me and I wanted to enjoy it. Eventually Izzy caught up to me and we rode together for a while, sometimes yoyo-ing back and forth as I’d stop to take more photos. Even if we weren’t talking much it was nice to have some company. The experience of riding up  and down massive cliffs covered in lupine and dropping down to the ocean was incredible. </p>

<p>Except for a few building structures that seemed mostly unoccupied, I felt like I was riding on the edge of the world. Much of the road resembled washed out rocky double track, there were abundant water crossings, and at times the gravel we were riding over turned into boulders the size of grapefruits. A considerable amount of walking was involved. It may have been slow going, but I didn’t want the section to end. It was some of the most incredible biking of my life and I wanted to soak it in for as long as possible. I couldn’t help but imagine how fun it would be to return and ride this section on a hardtail mountain bike with picnic stops on the hidden beaches.</p>

<p>This section alone made the whole race feel worth the effort, and made me feel grateful to experience such beauty on my bike. As we finally rounded the edge of the fjord and the gravel road eventually turned to pavement, a light rain began to come down. I was slightly annoyed by the rain, and feeling guilty for stopping to take so many photos, wondering if  I could have beat the rain if I’d ridden faster. I got down into my aero bars and settled into a faster pace. Oh well. I might’ve been a bit bothered, but this was the situation, and I could handle it. Luckily it wasn’t coming down too hard anyways. The drizzly section into Þingeyri went by fast and next thing I knew I was slurping down delicious sweet potato soup at the Simbahöllin cafe. After talking to some of the other riders and warming up in the heat of the cafe, I set out again. 2 more mountains to climb, with a coffee stop before the final ascent. The first past quickly. Before I knew it I was at  Kaffi Sól gorging myself on cookies before the final climb. I had 20 km to get back to Ísafjörður, 10 going up and 10 coming down. It doesn’t sound like much, but after hearing stories from others, I knew the final climb would be challenging. I tried to load up on snacks before leaving, knowing I still had a long ride ahead of me to the finish. I set out alone. One more mountain. </p>

<p>The road immediately began to slope upwards. I could see the tunnel that cuts the course as well as the gravel path that snakes up into the mountains above. As I left the pavement I immediately found myself off the bike and walking. The wind was so strong, the gradient so steep, and the gravel loose and chunky. If I had to walk to the finish I would. Up I went, sometimes walking, sometimes riding. When I could ride it was treacherous, the wind constantly threatening to blow me to the ground, or worse off a cliff. I played music and tried not to think about it. As I went up and up, the air got colder and the clouds settled in. It wasn’t snowing but there were patches of ice lining the road and covering the cliffs. My garmin read the temperature as being below freezing. I was wearing 5 layers to stay warm. I felt ok. It was an incredible and surreal experience. </p>

<p>As I made the final push to the top, the clouds opened up in front of me so that I could catch a glimpse of Ísafjörður below. As I began to descend the cold really set in. The wind was brutal. Usually I’m a confident and fast descender, but the road was still unpaved, bumpy, and the wind threatened to blow me over at any second. I gripped my brakes the whole way down. For a mountain descent it was slow going. I was pushing downhill into the wind. I didn’t feel comfortable going fast and risking a crash. My hands were freezing from the wind, and aching from gripping the brakes. I felt them going numb and tried not to panic. Just a few more kilometers. </p>

<p>I had to stop a few times to grip my chemical hand warmers and blow on my fingers to get feeling back so that I could continue to grip the brakes on my descent. I could see the finish, so close yet so far. Eventually the descent ended and I was back in Ísafjörður, just a few kilometers of flat ground between me and the end. I felt desperation as I rushed along the paved bike trail to the finish. I needed to finish. Finally, a little over 22 hours after leaving Patreksfjörður at midnight I was finished. When I crossed the line there was only one person waiting for me, the mother of another competitor who was a little behind me. She told me she didn’t want anyone to finish alone and guided me inside to the in-progress awards ceremony. The room was packed and I was overwhelmed. I took a seat on the floor as Tyler announced the female podium and gave closing remarks. I was in shock and could barely pay attention. The ceremony ended, Izzy had caught a ride into town instead of completing the final climbs and was there to wrap me in an aluminum emergency blanket. I shivered and tried to sip on a beer. </p>

<p>They’d stopped serving food at the restaurant an hour earlier. I didn’t feel strong for finishing, I felt weak and destroyed. I couldn’t talk to anyone. The crowd was overwhelming. I felt tears coming. I hid behind some race banners, and wept in a corner on the phone with James, unable to make coherent conversation. Izzy told me we should go back to her place so I could get a hot shower and sleep in a real bed. I was hypothermic from the descent, shaking from the cold and my emotions. I’d been holding it together for 5 days and it was all coming out.</p>

<p>We walked to her place and I took a hot shower while she made me pasta. The shower warmed me up and I stopped shaking. At least my appetite was alive and I was able to eat. It was already past midnight and I had a bus to catch at 9am back to Reykjavík. I’d have to wake up in the morning and disassemble my bike and pack all my things. It felt like a slap in the face that after all the riding and sleep deprivation I wouldn’t be able to get a good night’s rest. Izzy reassured me I could at least sleep some on the 6 hour bus ride. I called James to let him know I was safe and stayed on the phone till 3am talking through the intense emotions of the day. </p>
<h1 id="the-end-">The End:</h1>
<p>The next morning I made it on the bus, bags packed, coffee in hand, and emotionally drained. I was upset I wouldn’t get to say my goodbyes to my fellow racers that wouldn’t be on the bus. I didn’t feel the closure I was craving. I napped and booked an airbnb from the bus. Part of me wanted to go straight to the airport and leave, but I knew I’d be glad to have a few days of downtime once I was settled again that night. My last few days in Reykjavík were relaxed. I did get to spend time with and say my goodbyes to a few of the other racers, giving me a bit more closure. I got 2 tattoos on my left wrist. Bindrunes that represented “strong woman” on my outer wrist, and “courage” on my inner wrist, a location that’s always visible to my eyes while riding. </p>

<p>The strong woman tattoo represents my own strength, and that of the incredible women I rode with over the course of the week, who motivated and mentored me, encouraging me to keep trying when I wasn’t sure I could. I wanted courage to remind me of the courage it took to complete the race. Pushing onwards when I wasn’t sure I could. Pushing myself through emotionally and physically challenging situations. It took incredible courage to keep going. This race broke me and built me back up - over and over, day after day. While my official race may have been over on day 2 and I wasn’t able to complete the entire mileage, I still completed over miles (800 kilometers) with 33,220 ft (10125 meters) of climbing. I made it through 2 days of stomach pain, and 3 days of hypothermia symptoms. I only cried twice. I averaged 3.75 hours of sleep per night (including naps on my rest day) for the entire week of the race. I’ve done hard things before. I’ve had hypothermia symptoms and a panic attack while racing in the past. I’ve done 20 hour days on the bike. I’ve pushed through mud and rain, and even snow. I’ve had nausea and GI discomfort on long rides, but never lasting for more than half a day or so. I didn’t think much more could phase me, but this event was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I was prepared for the conditions and had the appropriate layers to deal with the weather. Having fully vegan meals probably would’ve helped with my stomach problems, but this ride still would’ve been incredibly challenging even with a better nutrient supply. </p>

<p>It’s been over a week since finishing and I’m still struggling to make sense of what happened. I set out looking for a solo adventure and to challenge myself in new ways, but got much more than what I was ready to handle on my own. I envied the competitors with family, friends, and partners there to support them. After this race, I don’t feel accomplished, I feel broken. Maybe competition and going fast isn’t for me. I don’t know why I choose to do things that put me in such danger. When a storm rolled in on a hike I did a few days ago, I found myself uncomfortable and panicked, despite the warm weather, my close proximity to the car, and the clear sign the wind was blowing the storm away instead of towards me. How many times have I been “rescued” in the last few months alone. Twice with James during training rides late at night, twice during the race. Is my search for discomfort and finding my limits more harmful than admirable? 
When I tell people my stories I’m called brave and strong, but it doesn’t feel that way. I feel stupid for putting myself in dangerous situations, and weak for needing help. Help doesn’t feel deserved when I’ve gotten myself into the trouble I’m in. Regardless, the help I received along the route was life changing. The Icelandic people opened their arms to me. My hypothermic episode at the fishing village was humbling, yet showed me the good in humanity that a group of strangers would welcome me into their home and offer me the help I didn’t realize how badly I needed. I’ll never forget Andrea telling me as I left to remember that it’s ok and sometimes courageous to ask for help. The group of Icelandic women I rode with adopted me into their families for the week. They treated me as one of their own, helping me, protecting me, mentoring me, and encouraging me to keep going. I couldn’t have done it without them. </p>

<p>I’m grateful for the experience. I’m proud of myself for pushing onwards to finish. I’m still entranced by the Icelandic landscape, in love with its beauty, and amazed by the hospitality, strength, resiliency, and kindness of its people. I’m already itching to go back, but next time bike touring on my own terms, where I can stop and explore the landscape, and take my time to get to know the scenery more intimately. </p>
