Hi there! I'm Daphne Smith (she/her) and I am currently getting my M.S. in Geosciences at the University of Texas at Austin. My research focuses on the dynamics of unsaturated fractured bedrock deep root zone water storage, and how they connect to drought in Central Texas.

In my free time I'm an avid cyclist, runner, and hiker. I love being outside in any capacity whether for recreation or doing field work.
