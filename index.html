    <p>Hi there! I'm Daphne Smith (she/her) and I am currently getting my M.S. in Geosciences at <a href="https://www.jsg.utexas.edu/">the University of Texas at Austin Jackson School of Geosciences</a>
        under the guidance of <a href="https://www.jsg.utexas.edu/researcher/daniella_rempe/">Dr. Daniella Rempe</a>. I also completed my B.S. in Hydrogeology from the Jackson School in 2022, and got started 
        on the work that would later become my Master's thesis after joining the Rempe lab as an undergraduate researcher in 2021. <br> 
        My research focuses on fractured bedrock deep root zone water storage in the vadose zone (also known as the unsaturated or critical zone), and the connection between vadose zone dynamics to drought in Central Texas. <br>
        In my free time I'm an <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/41060857">avid cyclist</a>, and I particularly enjoy gravel, bikepacking, and ultraracing. I also enjoy running, hiking, and being outside in any capacity whether for recreation or doing field work.
